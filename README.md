xml.c
=====

A fork of ooxi/xml.c having additional functions and some bugs fixed.

Similar to the [GLib Markup parser](http://developer.gnome.org/glib/2.34/glib-Simple-XML-Subset-Parser.html),
which also just parses an xml subset, [xml.c](https://github.com/ooxi/xml.c) is
a simple, small and self contained xml parser in one file. Ideal for embedding
into other projects without the need for big external dependencies.
